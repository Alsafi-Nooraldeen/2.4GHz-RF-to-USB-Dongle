# STM32_RF_USB-PCB

This design for 2.4GHz RF to USB Dongle:
STM32L4-based RF-to-USB dongle using a low-power NRF24 2.4GHz transceiver.
4-layer PCB designed in Altium.

This design utilizes an STM32L4 USB interface and an nRF24L01 2.4GHz module to establish a wireless connection between two hosts over a distance of more than 100 meters. To enhance coverage, the design includes an external SMA antenna connector, ensuring a wider and more reliable communication range.
